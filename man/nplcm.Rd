\title{Fit nested partially latent class models (low-level)}
\usage{
nplcm(Mobs, Y, X, model_options, mcmc_options)
}
\arguments{
\item{Mobs}{A list of measurements. The elements of the list
should include \code{MBS}, \code{MSS}, and \code{MGS}.
\itemize{
\item \code{MBS} is a data frame of bronze-standard (BrS) measurements.
Rows are subjects, columns are pathogens targeted in the BrS measurements
(e.g. nasalpharyngeal PCR). These mesaurements have imperfect sensitivity/specificty.
\item \code{MSS} is a data frame of silver-standard (SS) measurements. Rows are subjects,
  columns are pathogens targeted in the SS measurements (e.g. blood culture).
  These measurements have perfect specificity but imperfect sensitivity.
\item \code{MGS} is a data frame of gold-standard (GS) measurements. Rows are subject,
columns are pathogens targeted in the GS measurements. These measurements
have both perfect sensitivity and perfect specificity.
}}

\item{Y}{A vector of binary variables specifying the disease status (1 for case;
0 for control).}

\item{X}{A design matrix. For FPR and etiology regressions.}

\item{model_options}{A list of model options.

\itemize{
\item \code{M_use} List of measurements to be used in the model;
\item \code{k_subclass}The number of nested subclasses. It equals 1 if the
model is plcm; its value will be useful if the model is nplcm.
\item \code{TPR_prior} the prior for the measurements used. Its length should be
the same with \code{M_use};
\item \code{Eti_prior} the vector of parameters in etiology prior;
\item \code{pathogen_BrS_list} The vector of pathogen names with BrS measure;
\item \code{cause_list} The vector of causes, singleton, combinations, or 'NoA';
\item \code{X_reg_FPR} The vector of covariate names that stratify/regress
false positive rates (FPR);
\item \code{X_reg_Eti} The vector of covariate names that stratify/regress
 etiologies;
\item \code{pathogen_cat} The two-column dataframe that has category of pathogens: virus (V), bacteria (B)
and fungi (F);
\item \code{pathogen_SSonly_list} The vector of pathogens with only
SS measure;
\item \code{pathogen_SSonly_cat} The category of pathogens with only SS measure.
}}

\item{mcmc_options}{A list of Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) options.

\itemize{
\item \code{debugstatus} for whether to pause WinBUGS after it finishes
model fitting;
\item \code{n.chains} for the number of MCMC chains;
\item \code{n.burnin} for the number of burn-in samples;
\item \code{n.thin} keep every other n.thin samples after burn-in period;
\item \code{individual.pred} whether to perform individual prediction;
\item \code{ppd} whether to perform posterior predictive checking
\item \code{result.folder} for the path to folder storing the results;
\item \code{bugsmodel.dir} for the directory to WinBUGS model files;
\item \code{winbugs.dir} for the directory where WinBUGS 1.4 is installed.
}}
}
\value{
A WinBUGS result, fitted by function \code{bugs()} from
the R2WinBUGS package.
}
\description{
Uses WinBUGS in Windows system for Bayesian inference
(see README file for an instruction to install WinBUGS on windows 7 or 8.).
For stratification/regression functionalities, true positive rates are constant
across stratum or covariate values.\cr
Developer Note (DN):\cr
\itemize{
\item need to add checking empty cell functionality when performing
         stratification
\item need to use formula \code{cbind(Y1, Y2)~X1+X2} kind of symbolic
 model specification
to enable model estimation.
\item need to add ppd regression functionality
